# Adding Services

## Add a Web Portal

Need a web portals \(such as https://app.myproject.com\)? Scaffoldly has templates that are fully integrated with the Auth API and ready for login and basic account management.

Start from an available template:

* [Angular](../frontends/adding-a-frontend/angular.md)
* [Content Distribution Network \(CDN\)](../frontends/adding-a-frontend/cdn.md)

## Add APIs

Micro-services are the way to go. Our recommendation is to make many, narrowly focused services and avoid the monolithic API pattern. 

Scaffoldly makes it easy to provision a new API and there are templates available that are fully integrated with the Auth API and ready for use by the Web Portals and are integrated with the Auth API.

Start from an available template:

* [Serverless REST API](../backends/adding-a-backend/serverless-rest-api.md)
